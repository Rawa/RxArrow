## RxJava extensions for Arrow's Data Types

RxArrow is a lightweight library that adds RxJava convenient extension functions to [Arrow's Data Types](https://arrow-kt.io).

## Notice

Now, this library only support very few extension functions, but I will update it quickly in next few weeks.

## Danger

All of functions are subjects to change. So please serious consider copy/paste instead of use this library directly.

## Compatibility

Supports RxJava2 and Arrow version 0.10.0.
