# RxArrow

## RxJava extensions for Arrow's Data Types

RxArrow is a lightweight library that adds RxJava convenient extension functions to [Arrow's Data](https://arrow-kt.io).

## Notice

Now, this library only support very few extension functions, but I will update it quickly in next few weeks.

## Compatibility

This library support RxJava2 and Arrow version 0.10.0-Snapshot.
